# Prompt Format

Prompts follow this structure:

- **Description**: What it does and when to use it
- **Prompt**: The actual prompt in a fenced code block
- **Variables**: Parameters to customize (or "None")
- **Example Usage**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Tips**: Numbered practical advice

Keep prompts self-contained. A user should be able to copy-paste and get value immediately.
